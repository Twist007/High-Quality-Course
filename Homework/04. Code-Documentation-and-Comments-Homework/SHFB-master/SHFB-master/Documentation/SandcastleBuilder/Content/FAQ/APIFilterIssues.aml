the help file. Why?</title>

				<para>Check the build log in the section where it generated the API filter.  You will probably see a
warning there about the exclusion conflicting with the API filter.  The API filter always wins.  To fix the
issue, edit the <ui>API Filter</ui> project property and exclude the item there.</para>

			<title>I used the Namespace Summaries project option to exclude a namespace.  I now want it included but it
is not showing up.  Why?</title>
			<content>
				<para>Check the <ui>API Filter</ui> project property as it is probably being excluded in there.  This
situation does not generate a warning in the log so you have to check for it manually.  Simply place a checkmark
next to the item you want to have included.</para>

			<title>I used the &lt;exclude /&gt; tag to exclude a namespace/type/member.  I removed the tag as I now
want it included but it is not showing up.  Why?</title>

			<title>Why does the API filter uncheck/check the parent namespace/type if I uncheck/check more than half of
the types/members?</title>
			<content>
				<para>This behavior is by design.  See the <legacyBold>Including and Excluding Members</legacyBold>
section of the <link xlink:href="7df16a60-f718-4b8f-bfa2-88c42906070c#IncludeExclude" /> help
topic.  It is done to create a more efficient filter.  If more than half of the members are omitted, the parent
is written out as an exclude entry with child entries just for those marked for inclusion.  If more than half are
included, the opposite occurs.  Building the help file will result in the proper members being included or
excluded.  If you think you are seeing incorrect behavior with regard to the resulting help file, please supply
an example that demonstrates the problem.</para>
