			<title>My project relies on third-party assemblies and/or interop assemblies that do not have XML comments

			<content>
				<para>Third-party assemblies with or without XML comments files and Visual Studio generated interop
assemblies do not need to be documented.  They are considered to be dependent or reference assemblies.  As such,
add them to the <codeInline>References</codeInline> node in the Project Explorer window rather than as
documentation sources.  See the <link xlink:href="9309b01b-87bf-4d68-b035-c10ac77d1522" /> topic for more
information.</para>

			<title>How can I create an IntelliSense XML comments file that contains information on only the members
documented in the help file and excludes all of the private member details?</title>
			<content>
				<para>Add the <link xlink:href="5d546511-6aec-455a-ba09-9daffb124c6d" /> to the project using the
<codeInline>ComponentConfigurations</codeInline> project property.</para>

				<para>Create a standalone XML comments file and add it to the project as a documentation source.  See the
<link xlink:href="52aa172a-a310-4f75-b20f-7e2c7d870c65" /> help topic for details.</para>

		<section address="CreateComments">
			<title>I have an assembly without code and without an XML comments file for which I'd like to create
documentation and/or an Intellisense file.  How can I do that?</title>
			<content>
				<para>Create a blank XML comments file like the following and name it after the assembly with a
<localUri>.xml</localUri> extension:</para>

<code language="xml" title="Blank XML Comments File">
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;doc&gt;
	&lt;assembly&gt;
		&lt;name&gt;YourAssemblyNameHere&lt;/name&gt;
	&lt;/assembly&gt;
	&lt;members&gt;
	&lt;/members&gt;
&lt;/doc&gt;
</code>

				<para>Create a new help file builder project and add just that assembly and comments file to it as
documentation sources.  Select the <codeInline>ComponentConfigurations</codeInline> property and click the "..."
button to the right of it.  In the Component Configurations dialog, add the
<link xlink:href="5d546511-6aec-455a-ba09-9daffb124c6d" /> to the project.  Next, set the project's
<link xlink:href="5a2ab898-7161-454d-b5d3-959df0de0e36">Show Missing Tags</link> properties to your liking.  This
will force the build to add "missing" notes for all items that you might want to document.  Build the project and
you will find a new XML comments file named after the assembly in the project's output folder.  Edit the
<codeInline>&lt;member&gt;</codeInline> elements in the XML comments file to add the comments that you want for
each member.  For example:</para>

<code language="xml" title="Member Comments Example">
&lt;member name="M:SandcastleBuilder.Utils.XmlCommentsFileCollection.FindMember(System.String)"&gt;
	&lt;summary&gt;
	Search all comments files for the specified member.  If not found, add the
	blank member to the first file.
	&lt;/summary&gt;
	&lt;param name="memberName"&gt;The member name for which to search.&lt;/param&gt;
	&lt;returns&gt;The XML node of the found or added member&lt;/returns&gt;
&lt;/member&gt;
</code>

				<para>When you are done, replace your original placeholder file with the one generated from the build
with your edited comments.</para>
