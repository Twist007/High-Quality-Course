				<para>Check the log file for the <application>MRefBuilder</application> output.  It will most likely
report that it found and documented zero types.  This is caused by not having any public types in the documented
assemblies or not specifying any assemblies at all to document (i.e. the Documentation Sources project node is
empty or only contains XML comments files).  Sandcastle requires at least one assembly and will not document
internal and private code by default.  Be sure to declare at least one class public.  If all classes really are
supposed to be private and/or internal, set the <ui>Document Privates</ui> and/or <ui>Document Internals</ui>
project properties to true.</para>

			<title>Why is the help compiler failing with an HHC6003 error stating that itircl.dll has not been
registered?</title>
			<content>
				<para>This error affects a small number of people and is caused by one of the help components
(<localUri>itcc.dll</localUri>) either not getting installed or not getting registered correctly.  Search your
system for the DLL.  If not found, you can either locate it on another system that has the Help 1 components or
you can search Google for it.  Once you obtain it, you will need to copy it to the failing system and register
it.  This can be done by running the following command from a command prompt.  Adjust the path to the DLL as
necessary based on its location on your system.</para>

		<section address="Help1Crash">
			<title>The help 1 compiler (HHC.EXE) crashes with an exit code of -1073741515.  What does that mean?</title>
			<content>
				<para>Typically, this means that the help 1 compiler is not installed correctly or is missing one or more
of its components.  Download and install the Microsoft HTML Help Workshop to correct the problem.  A link for the
download can be found in the <link xlink:href="8c0c97d0-c968-4c15-9fe9-e8f3a443c50a" /> topic.  You may need to
do this even if the guided installer detects that the help 1 compiler is installed.  The HTML Help Workshop
installer may also state that it is already installed as well.  Complete the installation anyway to ensure that
all of the required components are present and registered correctly.</para>
